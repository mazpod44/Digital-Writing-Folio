# Week One and Three- Extra Readings 

Electronic literature is a significant shift from traditional print text, it utilises computer processes, interactivity, and multimedia elements to create immersive experiences. Works such as Taroko Gorge, The Gathering Cloud, First Draft of the Revolution, and Shade exemplify different aspects of electronic literature, offering differing ways of storytelling. 

Taroko Gorge is a generative poem that continuously shifts, producing new lines through programmed algorithms. This aligns with Hayles’ (2007) idea that electronic literature often incorporates programmed behaviour that affects meaning. 

The Gathering Cloud blends poetic text with visual elements to critique digital culture’s environmental impact. The juxtaposition of imagery and text makes the argument tangible, mirroring the interactive engagement discussed in Hayles (2007). 

First Draft of the Revolution integrates narrative with interactive choices, allowing readers to edit the letters in the story. This direct engagement aligns with Rosario et al.’s (2021) discussion on the role of reader interaction in shaping meaning. 

Shade explores perception and layering within the digital space, challenging the reader’s interaction with the site itself. This reflects Berens’ (2020) exploration of emergent digital literary networks, which describes electronic literature as something shaped through interaction. 

The meaningful aspects of these elements lie in how they define storytelling. Unlike print text, these works are not static narratives but instead require active engagement from the reader. This reinforces the concept that digital literature is fluid and ever moving. 

As discussed in Berens (2020), the structures of electronic literature challenge conventional models of authorship and accessibility. Digital literary works are frequently shaped by technological constraints and cultural biases embedded in platforms. In contrast to print literature, which can endure over centuries, digital works risk obsolescence due to technological shifts, making curation and preservation a significant concern—an idea central to the discussion in Hayles (2007) and Weeding the E-Lit Garden (Berens, 2020).
Building on Hayles' (2007) definition, electronic literature diverges from print in several ways:
•	Materiality: Print literature is bound to the physical book, while electronic literature depends on software and hardware and has fewer physical limitations.
•	Reader Role: In digital works, the reader may become a participant, actively shaping the narrative through interaction.
•	Archiving Challenges: As Rosario et al. (2021) note, electronic texts are ephemeral, requiring active curation to survive.
These distinctions highlight electronic literature’s evolving nature, demanding new approaches to reading and interpretation.

I thought Kissing the Steak: The Poetry of Text Generators was a fascinating piece on the poetry and potential of text generators. One of the most compelling aspects of Funkhouser’s discussion is the way he poses text generators not as tools but collaborators. This piece makes you rethink what poetry can be in the digital age, especially considering the new notions of authorship. I like that the piece suggests the answer to the question of whether text generators can create poetry, is completely nuanced and maybe that’s the beauty of it. Can a machine ever be a poet? Is poetry more than just words on a page?

Reading Beyond Taxonomy:Digital Poetics and the Problem of Reading by Memmott (2006) alongside Motte's (1986) introduction to Oulipo: A Primer of Potential Literature really made me think about the way I interact with texts. Memmott argues that digita literature isn't meant to be neat and categorised, its meant to be chaotic, interactive and constantly changing and evolving. The idea of clicking and engaging instead of passively reading resonated with me, because it made me think about how we already consume so much media just like that- jumping between links on a website, skimming a page, scrolling on a video, following every thread. It makes me wonder, are we perhps already participating in digital poetry without realising it. 

Oulipo, I suppose, takes the opposit eapproach, rigi constraints are a way to unlock creaticity. Writing a novel without the letter e or creating a poem using a maths formula forces you to find meaning in limitation. At first, I though Oulipo seemed restrictive, but the more I think about it, the more creative I consider it to be. Both approaches challenge traditional storytelling, so they make reading an active, rather than passive, process, whcih I have really come to enjoy and appreciate.

“What do you think of Aarseth’s concept of Ergodic Literature?”

Espen Aarseth’s concept of ‘ergodics’ shifts how we understand narrative, reading, and writing in hypertext. Traditionally, a narrative is associated with linear progression, with the author controlling the sequence of events and readers passively observing the story. Hypertext goes against this type of progression. Hypertext allows the readers interaction to be the central tool for the progression and experience of the text (Aarseth, 1997). 

Aarseth (1997) asserts that hypertext isn’t just a reconfiguration of narrative but an alternative to it, challenging traditional writing conventions. Unlike conventional narratives, ergodic literature necessitates reader interaction- shaping the structure and experience. 
This shift has interesting implications for both the reader and the writer. In a hypertext piece, the reader is not passive, but an active participant that determines/helps determine the trajectory of the narrative. By clicking on links, following different branches, selecting pathways, etc., the reader exercises agency in a way that resembles a co-authorship (Aarseth, 1997). Therefore, the writer creates a system of possibilities where multiple narratives can emerge, rather than a single definitive story. 

Hypertext literature, as explored by Aarseth (1997), alters conventional notions of closure and finality of a story. Usually, in linear storytelling, resolution is a key part, as is a beginning, middle and end. Hypertext, however, lacks a singular ending. It is open to interaction from readers and each experience between readers may differ. This allows the story to have multiple meanings and interpretations, rather than a fixed resolution. 

Furthermore, ergodic literature questions genre. Due to its non-linearity, hypertext is not defined by its content or themes, it is an approach to structuring text that prioritises reader agency (Aarseth, 1997). This changes the boundaries between fiction and non-fiction, author and audience, etc., making hypertext more of an aesthetic method rather than a traditional genre. 

Aarseth’s concept is relevant in the digital age of today, where interactive storytelling, gameplay, and digital writing continue to evolve with new programs and software. By prioritising a reader’s active engagement, hypertext focuses on agency and interactivity, offering an experience distinct from conventional narrative storytelling.

**Questions on previous works**

What is the relationship between the imagery and the text? 
Each piece uses visuals to strengthen its narrative themes. House on the Hill relies on eerie imagery to immerse the players in its mystery, enforcing the feeling of suspense I believe the author aimed for. Snow Season uses subtle details to enhance its introspective tone, reflecting the themes of isolation and internal conflict I believe it to have. Stay Strong xx contrasts past and present selves through narrative and visual elements, like the attached image of an IV drip or the schoolyard, illustrating the complexity of the illness.

How does the text change between readings? 
I think meaning changes depending on perspective. House on the Hill begins as something simple but slowly develops its mystery into a deeper exploration of trauma and family history. Snow Season changes based on personal experiences- some may find comfort, but some may find it somewhat constrictive. Stay Strong xx carries weight based on familiarity. One person may be able to empathise and observe the feelings this person experienced, however, another may feel it more deeply or personally, whether that be as a survivor or even relative. 

How does the work make you reflect on your own ideas and what you might do for your own piece?
These stories highlight the impact immersive/non-traditional storytelling can have. And I have realised I have to think about how the imagery can reinforce emotions and shift meaning dependent on the reader. I think I need to blend my personal experience more with the general themes in order to maintain connection with the audience. I am thinking of using a combination of the styles of 'snow season' and 'house on the hill'. I think that it would be interesting to have someone be moving through a space, but instead of a physical movement - like if I were to use bitsy- I would instead use images with text overlaid like in snow season. And instead of a piece of the text being used as the key to move on, I want to use an image/drawing of a keyhole. I think it would be really cool.

Montfort's chapter Riddles in Twisty Little Passages explores how riddles serve as a foundation for interactive fiction. He argues that riddles are more than what they seem- duh? - they require active engagement, interpretation and problem-solving. 
Both riddles and interactive fiction challenge us as readers to think beyond surface meaning and they reward us with resolution. Its fascinating to see how ancient literary forms influence digital storytelling too, the way we interact with narratives has always been growing and developing since the beginning of time. 

Emily Short's Savoir-Faire explores magic as a system of logic. Set in 18th century France, the story follows a nobleman using magical connections to solve puzzles and unover secrets. I find it fascinating how the game treats magic not as mystic and vague but as a structured, rule-based mechanic- almost like computer coding! I think it is a really clever blend of narrative and interactive fiction, I belive this contributes to Oulipo's idea of constraints enhancing rather than limiting.

Ensslin's The Paradox of Poetic Gaming explores how literary games blur the line between structure and artistic expression. In Evidence of Everything Exploding, you're forced to engage with fragmented, poetic elements rather than being guided throguh a clear story, making a subjective experience. This approach highlights how games can be more than entertainment, they can be experimental and really quite though-provoking.
