# Week One and Three- Extra Readings 

Electronic literature is a significant shift from traditional print text, it utilises computer processes, interactivity, and multimedia elements to create immersive experiences. Works such as Taroko Gorge, The Gathering Cloud, First Draft of the Revolution, and Shade exemplify different aspects of electronic literature, offering differing ways of storytelling. 

Taroko Gorge is a generative poem that continuously shifts, producing new lines through programmed algorithms. This aligns with Hayles’ (2007) idea that electronic literature often incorporates programmed behaviour that affects meaning. 

The Gathering Cloud blends poetic text with visual elements to critique digital culture’s environmental impact. The juxtaposition of imagery and text makes the argument tangible, mirroring the interactive engagement discussed in Hayles (2007). 

First Draft of the Revolution integrates narrative with interactive choices, allowing readers to edit the letters in the story. This direct engagement aligns with Rosario et al.’s (2021) discussion on the role of reader interaction in shaping meaning. 

Shade explores perception and layering within the digital space, challenging the reader’s interaction with the site itself. This reflects Berens’ (2020) exploration of emergent digital literary networks, which describes electronic literature as something shaped through interaction. 

The meaningful aspects of these elements lie in how they define storytelling. Unlike print text, these works are not static narratives but instead require active engagement from the reader. This reinforces the concept that digital literature is fluid and ever moving. 

As discussed in Berens (2020), the structures of electronic literature challenge conventional models of authorship and accessibility. Digital literary works are frequently shaped by technological constraints and cultural biases embedded in platforms. In contrast to print literature, which can endure over centuries, digital works risk obsolescence due to technological shifts, making curation and preservation a significant concern—an idea central to the discussion in Hayles (2007) and Weeding the E-Lit Garden (Berens, 2020).
Building on Hayles' (2007) definition, electronic literature diverges from print in several ways:
•	Materiality: Print literature is bound to the physical book, while electronic literature depends on software and hardware and has fewer physical limitations.
•	Reader Role: In digital works, the reader may become a participant, actively shaping the narrative through interaction.
•	Archiving Challenges: As Rosario et al. (2021) note, electronic texts are ephemeral, requiring active curation to survive.
These distinctions highlight electronic literature’s evolving nature, demanding new approaches to reading and interpretation.

# Week Two
**Extra Reading**

I thought Kissing the Steak: The Poetry of Text Generators was a fascinating piece on the poetry and potential of text generators. One of the most compelling aspects of Funkhouser’s discussion is the way he poses text generators not as tools but collaborators. This piece makes you rethink what poetry can be in the digital age, especially considering the new notions of authorship. I like that the piece suggests the answer to the question of whether text generators can create poetry, is completely nuanced and maybe that’s the beauty of it. Can a machine ever be a poet? Is poetry more than just words on a page?
