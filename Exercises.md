# Week one
## Initial Thoughts
<p> Today was a very overwhelming introduction to coding. However, i'm confident that it will become easier as we go. It seems that it will be something that I slowly develop my knowledge on and it will eventually become far simpler for me. </p>
<p> I am hoping that, in this lab, I will gain further understanding on how to elevate my writing by incorporating digital formatting and tools. I imagine there will be a lot of learning curves regarding complex digital tools like JavaScript.</p>

## Questions
**Digital Writing**
- What do you think digital writing is?

I believe digital writing creative work displayed in digital format, specifically made for the context of digital expression.
- What do you expect from the digital writing lab?

I am hoping that, in this lab, I will gain further understanding on how to elevate my writing by incorporating digital formatting and tools. I imagine there will be a lot of learning curves regarding complex digital tools like JavaScript.

**Your Writing**
- What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?

Fiction, auto-fiction and poetry.
- What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

I try to use imagery as much as possible, however, my writing has a major focus on internal dialogue, so the portrayal of emotions tends to be central technique I use.
- Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?

I use these tools because I believe they are the most effective way to express the emotions of characters and the characters' perception of the world around them. Hence, giving the audience a deeper understanding of both the characters and the context in which they exist.
- How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

Because of my focus on internal dialogue, my writing tends to lose dimension when the characters are interacting externally, whether that be through dialogue or action.
