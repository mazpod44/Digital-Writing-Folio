## Initial Thoughts/Reflection
<p> Today was a very overwhelming introduction to coding. However, i'm confident that it will become easier as we go. It seems that it will be something that I slowly develop my knowledge on and it will eventually become far simpler for me. </p>
<p> I am hoping that, in this lab, I will gain further understanding on how to elevate my writing by incorporating digital formatting and tools. I imagine there will be a lot of learning curves regarding complex digital tools like JavaScript.</p>

## Questions
**Digital Writing**
- What do you think digital writing is?

I believe digital writing creative work displayed in digital format, specifically made for the context of digital expression.
- What do you expect from the digital writing lab?

I am hoping that, in this lab, I will gain further understanding on how to elevate my writing by incorporating digital formatting and tools. I imagine there will be a lot of learning curves regarding complex digital tools like JavaScript.

**Your Writing**
- What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?

I tend to write fiction, auto-fiction and poetry.
- What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

I try to use imagery as much as possible, however, my writing has a major focus on internal dialogue, so the portrayal of emotions tends to be the central technique I use.
- Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?

I use these tools because I believe they are the most effective way to express the emotions of characters and the characters' perception of the world around them. Hence, giving the audience a deeper understanding of both the characters and the context in which they exist.
- How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

Because of my focus on internal dialogue, my writing tends to lose dimension when the characters are interacting externally, whether that be through dialogue or action. However, they allow my readers' connection with the characters to flourish. It's easy for them to find relatability, often through internal dialogue by way of the character.

## Electronic Literature Collection
**Carving in Possibilities by Deena Larsen Questions**
- What makes the work a piece of digital writing?

Deena Larsen's 'Carving in Possibilities' is an example of digital writing because it uses an interactive interface to engage readers in a unique way. The piece includes a blurred image of Michelangelo's David, which gradually becomes clearer as the user moves their mouse across the screen. This movement mimicks the act of carving, accompanied by sound effects that mimic the chisel's impact. The text itself is displayed in fragments, triggered by the user's interaction with the image.
It is this combination of visual, auditory, and textual elements, along with the interactive nature of the piece that makes 'Carving in Possibilities' a work of electronic literature.

-  Personal response. Whether you liked it, how it made you feel etc.

I found Carving in Possibilities to be quite interesting. The interactive nature of the piece creates a sense of involvement, as though you're not just a reader but an active participant in the narrative and the art itself. In an attemot tobe an active reader, I took different fragments from the piece and created an adaptation using these. It challenged me to see how both author and reader can interact and collectively create art. 

**The Fugue Book by Ton Ferret**

This work is a multimedia-driven, interactive piece that blends text and visuals to create a dynamic reading environment. Digital writing often incorporates nonlinear storytelling, interactivity, and algorithmic elements, and The Fugue Book appears to embrace these qualities by offering a unique way to engage with literature beyond traditional print. 

I find The Fugue Book fascinating because it challenges conventional reading experiences. The interplay between different media elements evokes emotions in unexpected ways, making the piece feel immersive and thought-provoking. 

**The First Draft of the Revolution by Emily Short and Liza Daly**

This work is an interactive epistolary novel that allows readers to engage with the process of letter-writing. Unlike traditional fiction, this piece doesnâ€™t use fixed text, instead inviting readers to rewrite and refine the letters, shaping the narrative. It uses technology to create this immersive experience that would not be possible in print.
I find First Draft of the Revolution fascinating because it transforms the act of writing into an interactive experience. The ability to edit and refine letters makes the reader an active participant in the story, mirroring the way real-life communication evolves through revision.

**A Modern Ghost by Artemio Morales**

It combines photo illustrations, an original soundtrack, and nonlinear storytelling, making it an immersive multimedia experience. 
I find its atmospheric visuals and reflective narrative compelling. The interactive elements enhance the emotional depth, making it feel personal and haunting.
