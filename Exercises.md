## Initial Thoughts/Reflection
<p> Today was a very overwhelming introduction to coding. However, i'm confident that it will become easier as we go. It seems that it will be something that I slowly develop my knowledge on and it will eventually become far simpler for me. </p>
<p> I am hoping that, in this lab, I will gain further understanding on how to elevate my writing by incorporating digital formatting and tools. I imagine there will be a lot of learning curves regarding complex digital tools like JavaScript.</p>

## Questions
**Digital Writing**
- What do you think digital writing is?

I believe digital writing creative work displayed in digital format, specifically made for the context of digital expression.
- What do you expect from the digital writing lab?

I am hoping that, in this lab, I will gain further understanding on how to elevate my writing by incorporating digital formatting and tools. I imagine there will be a lot of learning curves regarding complex digital tools like JavaScript.

**Your Writing**
- What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?

I tend to write fiction, auto-fiction and poetry.
- What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?

I try to use imagery as much as possible, however, my writing has a major focus on internal dialogue, so the portrayal of emotions tends to be the central technique I use.
- Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?

I use these tools because I believe they are the most effective way to express the emotions of characters and the characters' perception of the world around them. Hence, giving the audience a deeper understanding of both the characters and the context in which they exist.
- How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

Because of my focus on internal dialogue, my writing tends to lose dimension when the characters are interacting externally, whether that be through dialogue or action. However, they allow my readers' connection with the characters to flourish. It's easy for them to find relatability, often through internal dialogue by way of the character.

## Electronic Literature Collection
**Carving in Possibilities by Deena Larsen Questions**
- What makes the work a piece of digital writing?

Deena Larsen's 'Carving in Possibilities' is an example of digital writing because it uses an interactive interface to engage readers in a unique way. The piece includes a blurred image of Michelangelo's David, which gradually becomes clearer as the user moves their mouse across the screen. This movement mimicks the act of carving, accompanied by sound effects that mimic the chisel's impact. The text itself is displayed in fragments, triggered by the user's interaction with the image.
It is this combination of visual, auditory, and textual elements, along with the interactive nature of the piece that makes 'Carving in Possibilities' a work of electronic literature.

-  Personal response. Whether you liked it, how it made you feel etc.

I found Carving in Possibilities to be quite interesting. The interactive nature of the piece creates a sense of involvement, as though you're not just a reader but an active participant in the narrative and the art itself. In an attemot tobe an active reader, I took different fragments from the piece and created an adaptation using these. It challenged me to see how both author and reader can interact and collectively create art. 

**The Fugue Book by Ton Ferret**

This work is a multimedia-driven, interactive piece that blends text and visuals to create a dynamic reading environment. Digital writing often incorporates nonlinear storytelling, interactivity, and algorithmic elements, and The Fugue Book appears to embrace these qualities by offering a unique way to engage with literature beyond traditional print. 

I find The Fugue Book fascinating because it challenges conventional reading experiences. The interplay between different media elements evokes emotions in unexpected ways, making the piece feel immersive and thought-provoking. 

**The First Draft of the Revolution by Emily Short and Liza Daly**

This work is an interactive epistolary novel that allows readers to engage with the process of letter-writing. Unlike traditional fiction, this piece doesn’t use fixed text, instead inviting readers to rewrite and refine the letters, shaping the narrative. It uses technology to create this immersive experience that would not be possible in print.
I find First Draft of the Revolution fascinating because it transforms the act of writing into an interactive experience. The ability to edit and refine letters makes the reader an active participant in the story, mirroring the way real-life communication evolves through revision.

**A Modern Ghost by Artemio Morales**

It combines photo illustrations, an original soundtrack, and nonlinear storytelling, making it an immersive multimedia experience. 
I find its atmospheric visuals and reflective narrative compelling. The interactive elements enhance the emotional depth, making it feel personal and haunting. 

# Week Two

**Exercise- Coding Playground**

https://github.com/mazpod44/coding-playground

What aspects of the remix are the same?
I have kept the base of the coding playground. I did this to ground the site in something tangible and give myself some leeway to learn the ropes and understand how to remix a site and utilise glitch confidently. All of the cards have stayed the same and I have used the main coding aspects of all of them, only changing the content.
What aspects of the remix are different?
As part of the remix, I edited all the writing within the playground. I changed the font on the main title; I added images of my own through the assets tab and I altered the colouring and style on some cards through the style CSS sheet. I also decided to go against the rules of the poems initially in the playground (didn’t do haiku etc.).

Is the remix successful (why or why not)?
I think the remix was successful as I was able to alter all the components to create my own poems, styles, variations and visuals. However, I believe the end product could have been more successful as I had minor issues with creating the exact presentation I wanted. 

**Reflection**

How do you feel about coding now versus how you felt going into this in Week 1?
I’m still not very confident in my coding abilities, however, I feel like I have expanded my scope of what I believe to be possible for me to complete. I’m still not confident, but I appreciate that its possible for me to learn more than I expected. 

Has your hands-on engagement with interactive digital literature shifted the way that you 'read' e-lit? In what ways?
I think it’s just made me appreciate how difficult it is to do some of the simplest changes within a digital piece. I realise now that a simple change of font, for example, takes much more than clicking the times new roman tab underneath a font button. It requires a change in the stylesheet, and you must find the specific code for the font. Same goes for colour, not clicking on a wheel, but having to find the exact hex code and entering that into the stylesheet correctly. 

# Week Three

**To Make a Dadaist Poem**
I used an article titled Mushroom cook says fear of estranged husband’s actions led to phone resets; details dumping food dehydrator at local tip after fatal lunch, from the Erin Patterson trial currently ongoing.

**Lipograms**
Chosen constraint: The letter e.

A soft wind sways amid blooms of joyous light
Nights pass, days too
Birds hum, singing songs of a warm kiss

**Mesostics**
There’s not enough of me to be enough. I search the field. God, make me a flower so I can be beautiful. Please, Lord, make me a flower—even if it’s only for a moment. Care for me before I am blown away. I want to be wished upon.
Word: Incandescent

**N+7**
Replacing every noun with the seventh noun that is found after it in a dictionary, using an extract from the song ‘Better Than Me’ by Blood Orange. 

Original: 
Know my worth and fake the blame
But I know she's better than me
Wait your turn and change your ways
But I know he's better than me

N+7 Version:
Know my wound and fake the blast
But I know she’s better than me
Wait your twist and change your wealth
But I know he's better than me. 

# Week Seven
**Reflection on Feedback and Peer presentations**

What are the themes and ideas is your piece is exploring?
The themes that my piece is exploring are identity, transformation and longing.  

What literary genre or style are you drawing on? Is it narrative driven or more poetic and associative? Or essayistic?
I am drawing on a poetic and associative style for this piece. The piece is driven by a poetic transformation that is progressing as the reader discovers new fragments.

Succinctly: What is the story? Or what do you want to express/communicate through this piece?
The story is one of longing to belong and eventually becoming comfortable with ones fragility and therefore losing fear of it.

What do you wish their reader to understand of feel?
The intent is to connect with readers who resonate with themes of introspection, transformation, and existential longing. It speaks to those who seek meaning in impermanence, anyone who has felt small in a vast world. The poem invites reflection, making it particularly impactful for individuals drawn to meditative or evocative literature.

What drives the reader’s momentum through the piece?
I’m hoping that the desire to see the progression of the writer will drive the momentum through the piece.

How does the literary and the digital drive the momentum together with the pieces thematic?
The images and highlighted words should evoke emotions that contribute to the piece. And you’re able to move through the space while focusing on those emotions.

Do you need to develop the story/concept/narrative further in order to answer the above questions? how will you do this? By mapping? By writing it out?
I need to develop the story further; I need to finish writing the piece mainly. I will do this by mapping out the general ideas of the piece and the different themes of the vignettes. 

# Week Eight
**Mapping Ideas**

**Scope and Scale**
How many words will it be?
350ish words

How many screens?
6-8

What do you need to do on a week-by-week basis (is this realistic?)
Complete the readings and write at least on vignette a week.

What is the tech that might get you stuck? what is the workaround/Plan B?
Images are difficult to add, I will need to find the correct code and learn to use it properly.

**First Draft Mind Map**

I used Miro Board to map the general idea of my final piece. I wanted to use squares to show a sequence of passages on Twine. Attached to each of them is their accompanying text extract, visual, theme and interaction. This will help me guide the flow of my piece.

**Final Draft Mind Map**

I used Miro Board once again to map the final concept for my piece. Instead of having six total passages, I decided to design seven. In the initial stages of the piece, I had only planned to use the mesostic poem I created in class as the whole piece. However, after further planning and, more specifically, the second assignment, I realised there needed to be more content for me to fully express the longing I wanted. Another piece of feedback that warranted change, was the use of the keyholes. I initially created them to use as a linking gateway between passages; however, I realised that they didn’t suit the further progressed idea of the piece. So, those are no longer included in the Miro board, or my Twine project. Instead of the interaction being the keyholes, I have used a chosen word from each vignette of the poem to act as the passageway. I am hoping that the ideas on my board are clear and that they can come to fruition.
