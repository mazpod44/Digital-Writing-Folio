# Week one
## Initial Thoughts
<p> Today was a very overwhelming introduction to coding. However, i'm confident that it will become easier as we go. It seems that it will be something that I slowly develop my knowledge on and it will eventually become far simpler for me. </p>
<p> I am hoping that, in this lab, I will gain further understanding on how to elevate my writing by incorporating digital formatting and tools. I imagine there will be a lot of learning curves regarding complex digital tools like JavaScript.</p>
